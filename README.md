# What I learned   

Securing and encryptying sensitive information with git-crypt. API keys are automatically encrypt when pushed to github and decrypted when pulled. 

Modern javascript **Promises** to enforce behaviour of asnychronous functions. I found promises are great for simplify code and easier to debug and maintain then chained callbacks. 

New NPM tools including:
* Yargs: handles command line / text input, can enforce and verify arguments validity. 
* axios: very useful library to make http request / API calls with javascript Promises.
